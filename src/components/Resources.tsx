    question: "What is mindfulness?",
    answer: "Mindfulness is the practice of purposely focusing your attention on the present momentâ€”and accepting it without judgment. It involves being aware of your thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment."
  },
  {
    question: "How can journaling help my mental health?",
    answer: "Journaling allows you to clarify your thoughts and feelings, know yourself better, reduce stress, solve problems more effectively, and resolve disagreements with others. Writing about stressful events helps you come to terms with them, reducing the impact these stressors have on your physical health."
  },
  {
    question: "What are affirmations and do they really work?",
    answer: "Affirmations are positive statements that can help you challenge and overcome self-sabotaging and negative thoughts. When repeated often, and with conviction, they can start to make positive changes to how you think and feel. Research suggests they may help by encouraging your brain to form new clusters of positive thought neurons."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I practice breathing exercises?",
    answer: "For best results, try to practice breathing exercises for at least 5-10 minutes each day. You can start with shorter sessions and gradually work up to longer ones. Many people find it beneficial to practice in the morning to start their day with a clear mind, and in the evening to release the day's stress."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take to see improvements in my mental health?",
    answer: "Everyone's journey is different. Some people notice benefits from mindfulness practices and other mental health strategies within days or weeks, while for others it may take months of consistent practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small improvements along the way."
